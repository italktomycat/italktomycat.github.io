This project was developed for the Spring 2020 - Introduction to Web Develpment course at FrauenLoop (https://www.frauenloop.org).

We were given a text file with the content to the website, and were given all freedom to develop it.

I've used HTML, CSS and JavaScrit, and the menu for foods and sweets is being requested from a Google Sheet.
